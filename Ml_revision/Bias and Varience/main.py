    # Bias:
    - bias is a mesurement of how accurately a model
      can capture a pattern in training dataset.
    - train error


    # Variance:
    - variance is a measurement of how accurately a model
      can capture a pattern in testing dataset
    - test error


    # overfit:
    - model perform well on training data but not on testing data
    - high variance
    - low bias


    # underfit:
    - model doesn't perform well on training as well as testing data
    - low variance
    - high bias
