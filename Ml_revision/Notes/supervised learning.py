    # Supervised ml:
      - In supervised machine learning model are trained using label data,
        label data contains output tagged with it.

      - Types:
            a] Regression : used for predict the continuous value for example predict score,marks etc.
            b] Classification : used for predict categorical values for example
                loan approval has only two categories  yes or no like that.

      - Model Evaluation metrics:
        In summary, model evaluation metrics are essential tools in the machine learning lifecycle.
         They help you assess, compare, and improve models, make informed decisions,
         and ensure that models meet their intended objectives while
         aligning with business or research goals.


        i] regression metrics:
        - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): MAE measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values.
            It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

        - Mean Squared Error (MSE): MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
            It gives more weight to large errors and is sensitive to outliers.

        - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides an interpretable metric in
            the same units as the target variable.

        - R-squared (R2): R-squared measures the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is
            predictable from the independent variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher value indicates a better fit.
